Report for Out-of-date Version (OpenSSL):-

URL :
Identified Version	: 0.9.8e
Latest Version		: 1.1.1k

Operating System 	: Kali Linux
Tools			: Netsparker

Summary:-
Zero Bank's main website hhttps://zero.webappsecurity.com/  has an endpoint that is vulnerable as it has Out-of-date Version (OpenSSL) version 0.9.8e. As this is a old version of OpenSSL it is a critical threat to the website as an black hat attacker might take advantage of this. Also support for 0.9.8e has ended in 2006.

Impact:-
1.) A flaw in DTLS support - An attacker could create a malicious client or server that could trigger a heap overflow.

2.) A flaw was found in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() utility function- An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this function and overrun a buffer with a single byte. Few applications make use of this vulnerable function and generally it is used only when applications are compiled for debugging

Remedy:-
Please upgrade your installation of OpenSSL to the latest stable version i.e. 1.1.1k
